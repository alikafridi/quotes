# About

Every once in a while I come across quotes that I like and want to remember and refer back to. I've kept an Evernote of these in the past, but I've decided to move these to Github. This way the quotes are public, and others can see what I'm enjoying. It'll also be a sneaky way to increase my git commits, without actually having to write more lines of code ;)

## Quotes

"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." - Thomas Edison

"Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option." - Maya Angelou

“Eventually never happens. If you want to travel, start saving now. If you want to do something, start immediately. You don’t need to wait until you’re better at it, or until you’re more confident, or until the “timing is right”. You need to start and learn and fall and adapt and adjust. That’s where the growth happens” - Steve Kamb
