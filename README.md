# About

Every once in a while I come across quotes that I like and want to remember and refer back to. I've kept an Evernote of these in the past, but I've decided to move these to Github. This way the quotes are public, and others can see what I'm enjoying. It'll also be a sneaky way to increase my git commits, without actually having to write more lines of code ;)

## Quotes

"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." - Thomas Edison

"Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option." - Maya Angelou

“Eventually never happens. If you want to travel, start saving now. If you want to do something, start immediately. You don’t need to wait until you’re better at it, or until you’re more confident, or until the “timing is right”. You need to start and learn and fall and adapt and adjust. That’s where the growth happens” - Steve Kamb

“... really invest in friendships. Show up for important events - weddings, birth of children, death of parents. Get on a plane, get in the car, get on the train, and just show up.” - Michael Skolnik

“Know that the only one who can make things happen for you is you. And don’t give a damn what anyone else thinks about what you want to do - just go do it and make it happen.” - Cindy Gallop

“There won’t ever be a startup as important as you are. If you’re not taking care of yourself first, you’ll never amount to greatness. Seriously.” - Peter Shankman

“You might fail at whatever you do, so you might as well dream big, because then if you succeed, you succeed big.”

"Rebecca had broken one of the unspoken rules of her hierarchical workplace; never witness the humiliation of your boss." - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/26/gender.workandcareers

"Things don’t “happen for a reason. But you can find purpose and meaning in things that do happen. Things don’t happen for a reason. But how you respond can reveal your true character. Things don’t happen for a reason. But they do often happen because nobody has yet found a better way." - [Jeff Huber](https://medium.com/newco/find-a-better-way-19e9dde7a2fd#.kkwnwedi9)

"You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." - Steve Jobs

"Once bitten, twice shy"

"Looking back at my ambition to become a lawyer, it looks less like a plan for the future and more like an alibi for the present. **It was a way to explain to anyone who would ask—to my parents, to my peers, and most of all to myself—that there was no need to worry. I was perfectly on track.** But it turned out in retrospect that my biggest problem was taking the track without thinking really hard about where it was going." - [Peter Thiel's commencement address](http://fortune.com/2016/05/22/transcript-peter-thiel-hamilton/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE)
